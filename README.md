# JavaScript Algorithm Practice

## Overview

This project contains a collection of JavaScript functions implementing common algorithms, along with their corresponding unit tests using Jest. It serves as a practice ground for honing JavaScript skills and understanding fundamental programming concepts.

## Implemented Algorithms

The following algorithms are currently implemented:

- **Capitalize:** Capitalizes the first letter of a string.
- **Reverse String:** Reverses a given string.
- **Calculator:** Provides basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
- **Caesar Cipher:** Encrypts a string using the Caesar cipher.
- **Analyze Array:** Analyzes an array of numbers, returning the average, minimum, maximum, and length.

## Run Test
```
npm run test
```
