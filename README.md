# TDD Practice with Jest and Babel
## Overview
This project is a practical exercise in Test-Driven Development (TDD), using Jest as the testing framework and Babel to transpile modern JavaScript (ES6+) for compatibility. The goal is to build reliable, well-tested applications by writing tests first, then implementing functionality based on those tests.
